 * field, and a key hint. A caller opens it for a destination buffer, the user
 * edits a working copy with the cursor-cycle keys, and ENTER writes it back
 * (ESC discards). It is pushed like any other view (`NavIntent::push`); because
 * the render loop clears to Background and paints only the top view, it fully
 * covers whatever it was opened over.
 *
 * Result delivery matches the existing in-place editors: on commit it writes
 * the destination buffer (a settings field) and optionally requests an rtx
 * resync, so the opener's change-gated syncFromState picks it up on return.
