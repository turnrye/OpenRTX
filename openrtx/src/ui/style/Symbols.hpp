/*
 * UTF-8 glyph strings for toolkit-specific marks baked into the custom icon
 * font at Private-Use-Area code points. These are a UI concern (what a glyph is
 * called), distinct from the font/gfx backend (which just owns glyphs at code
 * points), so they live here rather than in core/graphics.h alongside the
 * generic FontAwesome icon macros.
 *
 * The custom icon font is a fallback layer separate from both the Ubuntu text
 * glyphs and the FontAwesome subset. Its marks are produced from committed SVGs
 * (e.g. openrtx/fonts/m17_logo.svg) by scripts/gen_fonts.sh (see docs/fonts.md)
 * and rendered like any other glyph, so they inherit the anti-aliased blit,
 * sizing, alignment and theme colour of text — single-colour silhouettes that
 * work on colour and 1bpp targets.
